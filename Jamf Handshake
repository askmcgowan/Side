-- Created by Travis Green 01.24.2025
-- This is an Apple Script for when the Jamf handshake connection breaks
-- Rather than walking the user through opening terminal and running "sudo jamf policy" along with any other command lines, they simply open this .app in the /Application folder, and it does the rest.
-- Methode:
-- -It asks for user password - then looks for MDM profiles
-- -If no profiles are found, it runs "sudo profiles renew -type enrollment"
-- - - It asks for user password again, and re-enrolls it
-- -If profiles already exist, it runs "sudo jamf policy"
-- -If it works, odds are it fixed the handshake
-- -If it does not work, it then tries "sudo profiles renew -type enrollment"
-- -If that also fails, it displays that both handshake and re enrollment failed

-- How To:
-- - Copy the code below and place it in Script Editor - modify the dialogs if you like
-- - Save it as an .app file
-- - Deploy it to the device via your MDM

if button returned of dialogResponse is "Cancel" then
